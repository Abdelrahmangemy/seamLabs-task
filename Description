On Branch Master I've added : 
Api foulder into app/http/controller that contain :
4 controllers first is CountMinOperations that implement point 3 in part one 
second is CountRange that implement point 1 in part one
third is indexOfString that implement point 2 of part 1
fourth is UserController that implement part 2
And there's a foulder Auth that contain register and login controller and to Authenticate User I used laravel Passport 
I also updated the user model and its migration 
also added the routes needed into api.php
